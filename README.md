# Website-for-Articles-using-APIs

Create Article API's:

 - create an article with the title, article content and author name.

 - API to up vote the existing article using article id

 - list the articles which are ordered by number of votes in descending order(higher votes at the top).

 
Javascript - Create UI for the above Article API's.

 - two screens, one for creating the articles and one for listing the articles.

 - in the articles list page itself user should be able to vote for a particular article and should be updated on the back end.

 - minimal UI would be sufficient.
